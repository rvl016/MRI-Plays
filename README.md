# MRI Plays
## You can look at: 
### 1. ./Python/mri_procStream.py 
 		for a basic script with queues, forks and interprocess communication via multiple pipes.
### ./Python/mri_search.py 
 		for creation of a graph database of MRI files.
### ./Bash/script_3.0.sh
 		for a ugly bash version of the contents from ./Python folder. My first bash experience.
### ./Bash/take_notes.sh
 		for a dialog based script that provides a clean interface for taking notes on a MRI file, showing its attributes by using the basic bash string macros on the filename.
